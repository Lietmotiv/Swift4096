swift-2048
==========

A port of [iOS-2048](https://github.com/austinzheng/iOS-2048) to Apple's new Swift language. The game is present and working, but a number of auxiliary features haven't yet been implemented.

Like the original Objective-C version, swift-2048 does not rely upon SpriteKit. See the description for iOS-2048 for more information.

Instructions
------------

You will need the Xcode 6 Developer Preview to build and run the project. However, it should run under either iOS 7 or iOS 8 (on the simulator).

Tap the button to play the game. Swipe to move the tiles.

Thoughts on Swift
-----------------

Swift is great. Pattern matching, tuples, and typeclasses are amazing. Programming in Swift feels much closer to programming in Scala than in Objective-C. Types are important again.

It's a little disappointing that Apple hasn't provided closure-based callbacks for UIKit controls. Selectors seem pretty hacky in Swift, but they do work.

Still have no idea how to make things private, public, or protected. In Objective-C you could hide internal details away in the .m file. In Swift, everything is exposed by default.

Initializing n-dimensional arrays is painful.

Xcode is as unstable as always. The background compiler/code analyzer kept on crashing and restarting itself. Xcode was functional enough to allow the project to be brought to some state of completion. The debugger is horribly broken though.
